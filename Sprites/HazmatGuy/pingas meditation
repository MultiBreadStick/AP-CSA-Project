Pingas meditation is one of the most fascinating yet beautiful strategies I've ever experienced.
I've shown pingus strategies before, but I want you to try it for yourself.
The human auditory system is most sensitive to frequencies between 2000 and 5,000 hertz, but this pingas method will completely blow you away.
Close your eyes, and let the auditorial bliss engulf you.
Pay attention to the left and right channels.
You'll feel a sense of comfort and relief immediately.
