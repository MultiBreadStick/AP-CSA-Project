Our project is Koo Quest, a game in which you play as Hazmat Guy and walk around avoiding the Pingas Guy.
To start, upload the folder to VSCode, go to main.java, and click "Run main."
Right now the game is playable but incomplete as per our vision. The only thing you can do right now is walk around while the Pingas Guy follows you.
Use WASD to move around
